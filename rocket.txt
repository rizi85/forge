The Final Countdown

The countdown had begun.

Ten… nine… eight…

Commander Lila Torres tightened her grip on the armrests of her seat. The vibrations of the rocket rumbled through her suit, a steady reminder that she was strapped to thousands of tons of controlled explosions. Years of training had led to this moment—her first mission to Europa, Jupiter’s icy moon.

Seven… six… five…

“Systems green across the board,” her co-pilot, Raj Patel, reported.

Lila exhaled. “Let’s make history.”

Four… three…

She thought of the thousands of people watching from Earth, their eyes glued to screens, their breaths held in anticipation. Somewhere in the crowd, her father stood, just as he had on the day she launched her first model rocket as a child.

Two… one…

The engines roared, a monstrous force pushing against gravity itself. Fire and smoke erupted below as Odyssey One tore free from the planet’s grip, racing into the sky.

Zero.

The shaking settled into a smooth, rapid ascent. Lila glanced out the window. Below, the Earth shrank, a brilliant blue and white marble against the darkness. Ahead, the infinite unknown awaited.

“Europa, here we come,” she whispered.

And with that, humanity’s next great journey had begun.
